<h1>Quantum Yield Pre-Seed Funding Business Plan</h1>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Quantum Yield envisions a paradigm shift in yield analysis, moving away from conventional parametric approaches towards a dynamic, human-centric interaction with AI models. Our mission is to first apply this new paradigm shift in the financial market, where accurate and adaptive forecasting is critical for managing risk and optimizing investment strategies. We aim to elevate human intelligence through AI collaboration, creating an intuitive and adaptive forecasting experience that empowers users to make insightful decisions without being constrained by traditional model structures.</p>
<p>Our patent-pending technology redefines yield curve forecasting by seamlessly integrating AI-anchored models with rapid, on-the-fly forecasting capabilities, enhanced by intelligent synthetic training processes that are significantly faster than traditional training methods—without sacrificing accuracy. This unique approach allows users to explore yield dynamics efficiently, much like how distillation accelerates model training. By fostering a symbiotic relationship between human intelligence and AI, Quantum Yield positions itself at the forefront of the next generation of yield analysis.</p>
<p>Yield curve forecasting applied to the US Treasury yields is just the beginning. Our technology is inherently versatile, capable of application beyond finance into any field where yield-based decision-making is critical. By fundamentally changing how users interact with forecasting models, Quantum Yield aims to become a transformative force in the financial technology landscape and beyond.</p>
<p>Our edge lies in the AI model’s tremendous capability for pattern recognition, regardless of the underlying assets, enabling futuristic time-series forecasting of yields. The quality of training models is essential to our technology because they serve as anchors for reliable forecasting. As AI models are not without limits, we incorporate dynamic features into the workflow to ensure outcomes are optimal. This adaptive approach allows the system to maintain accuracy and relevance even as economic conditions evolve.</p>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Conventional parametric approaches to yield forecasting fall short in modeling the inherent non-linearity of today’s complex and convoluted financial ecosystems. These legacy models are limited in their ability to adapt, often assuming overly simplified relationships that fail to capture the true dynamics of economic environments.</p>
<p>Quantum Yield addresses this challenge by designing models that not only seek optimality but also enable intuitive interaction and transparency for users, thereby bridging the gap between powerful AI performance and human understanding.</p>
<h2>Our Solution</h2>
<p>Quantum Yield’s technology reimagines how humans and AI interact in the context of yield analysis. By incorporating anchored models that provide quick, on-the-fly forecasting, we allow users to dynamically explore yield scenarios. Our approach fosters collaboration between human intelligence and AI, where users actively engage with model outputs during training to ensure they're optimized and well-tuned. During the forecasting process, we refine outputs through intuitive interaction.
    A key enabler of this responsiveness is our patent-pending surrogate modeling layer that accelerates the training workflow by an order of magnitude of 10x. Internal testing demonstrated performance improvements from over 60 seconds down to just 6 seconds in training time. This leap in efficiency makes real-time forecasting and scenario analysis truly tenable, allowing users to iterate rapidly and adapt to changing market conditions with minimal latency.</p>
<h2>Market Opportunity</h2>
<p>The first focus area for Quantum Yield is the financial market's risk management sector, particularly in interest rate modeling and strategy, treasury management, providing future cashflow-based yield forecast analysis. This includes financial instruments, asset and liability (A&amp;L) management, and risk assessment for banks, insurance companies, and asset managers.</p>
<p>Our initial stage of deployment will focus on the U.S. financial market, where regulatory structure, data accessibility, and institutional demand provide an ideal launch environment. We will simultaneously begin planning for global expansion, targeting developed markets in Europe and Asia where yield curve modeling is critical for managing macroeconomic uncertainty.</p>

<ul>
<li>The note will convert into equity of the Company upon the occurrence of a qualified financing event (e.g., Series A funding).</li>
<li><strong>Discount:</strong> The Investor will receive a 20% discount on the price per share paid by the investors in the next financing round (or the price per share based on the valuation cap).</li>
<li><strong>Valuation Cap:</strong> The valuation cap for the conversion is set at $4,000,000.</li>
<li><strong>Qualified Financing Event:</strong> A qualified financing is typically defined as a round of equity financing in which the Company raises at least **$1,000,000** in new capital. The occurrence of a qualified financing event triggers the automatic conversion of the note into equity.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>2. Interest Rate:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>The note will accrue 0% interest until the note is converted into equity or repaid.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>3. Maturity Date:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>If the qualified financing event has not occurred by the maturity date, the note will be repayable at the face value of the note, including any accrued interest, unless converted into equity at the Company’s discretion.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>4. Automatic Conversion:</strong></li>

</ul>
<li><strong>5. Conversion Price:</strong></li>
<ul>

<li><strong>Option 2: Repayment</strong> – If the Investor does not wish to convert, they will receive their principal investment back, ahead of equity holders, as part of the payout from the event. If the liquidity event proceeds are insufficient to pay all investors, the Investor may receive a pro-rata portion of the payout alongside other creditors.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li><strong>7. Equity Ownership:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Upon conversion, the Investor’s equity ownership in the Company will be determined by the conversion price relative to the Company’s valuation at the time of conversion.</li>
