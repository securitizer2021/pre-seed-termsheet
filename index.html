        <h2>Key Terms:</h2>
        <ul class="term-list">
            <li><strong>1. Conversion of the Note:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>The note will convert into equity of the Company upon the occurrence of a qualified financing event (e.g., Series A funding).</li>
                <li><strong>Discount:</strong> The Investor will receive a 20% discount on the price per share paid by the investors in the next financing round (or the price per share based on the valuation cap).</li>
                <li><strong>Valuation Cap:</strong> The valuation cap for the conversion is set at $4,000,000.</li>
                <li><strong>Qualified Financing Event:</strong> A qualified financing is typically defined as a round of equity financing in which the Company raises at least **$1,000,000** in new capital. The occurrence of a qualified financing event triggers the automatic conversion of the note into equity.</li>
            </ul>

            <li><strong>2. Interest Rate:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>The note will accrue 0% interest until the note is converted into equity or repaid.</li>
            </ul>

            <li><strong>3. Maturity Date:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>If the qualified financing event has not occurred by the maturity date, the note will be repayable at the face value of the note, including any accrued interest, unless converted into equity at the Company’s discretion.</li>
            </ul>

            <li><strong>4. Automatic Conversion:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>If a qualified financing event occurs, the note will automatically convert into the same class of stock as the new investors in that financing round.</li>
            </ul>

            <li><strong>5. Conversion Price:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>The conversion price is the lower of the price per share at the next round (after applying a 20% discount), or the price per share implied by the valuation cap of $4,000,000.</li>
            </ul>

            <li><strong>6. Optional Conversion (Change of Control, Acquisition, or Liquidation Event):</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>In the event of a liquidity event (such as acquisition, change of control, or liquidation), the Investor may choose one of the following options:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Option 1: Convert to Equity</strong> – The Investor may convert the note into equity at the valuation cap or discounted conversion price (as applicable), and participate in the distribution of the proceeds from the event based on their equity ownership.</li>
                    <li><strong>Option 2: Repayment</strong> – If the Investor does not wish to convert, they will receive their principal investment back, ahead of equity holders, as part of the payout from the event. If the liquidity event proceeds are insufficient to pay all investors, the Investor may receive a pro-rata portion of the payout alongside other creditors.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <li><strong>7. Equity Ownership:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Upon conversion, the Investor’s equity ownership in the Company will be determined by the conversion price relative to the Company’s valuation at the time of conversion.</li>
            </ul>

            <li><strong>8. Warrants/Options:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>The Investor may receive a warrant (right to purchase additional shares) for [x]% of the equity on the same terms as the Series A financing.</li>
                <li>However, the issuance of such warrants is subject to the approval and terms of the Series A termsheet. If the Series A investors do not agree to include warrants, the Investor may not receive them.</li>
            </ul>

            <li><strong>9. Use of Proceeds:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>The Investment will be used by the Company to finance operating costs including legal fees, business development, marketing, and other expenses associated with getting the Company ready for its next round of financing.</li>
            </ul>

            <li><strong>10. Other Provisions:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Board Representation:</strong> The Investor will not have the right to appoint a board member at this stage but will have observer rights in board meetings.</li>
                <li><strong>Information Rights:</strong> The Investor will be entitled to quarterly financial reports and annual updates on the Company’s financial condition.</li>
                <li><strong>Anti-Dilution Protection:</strong> In the event of a down round or issuance of additional shares at a price lower than the conversion price, the Investor will receive anti-dilution protection (adjusting their equity position accordingly).</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
